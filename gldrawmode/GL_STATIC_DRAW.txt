Q:
I have a textured polygon mesh that I plan to be
move-able based on the user's various inputs. For
example: the user can move the vertices in various
directions. But the number of vertices and the texture
coordinates will always be constant.Is this a good
situation to use GL_STATIC_DRAW, or should i use something
else, like GL_STREAM_DRAW?

A:
No, your situation is not a good case to use GL_STATIC_DRAW.
As h4lcOn's link suggests you should use dynamic or stream.
Though if I understand correctly what you are trying to do
I wouldn't even use VBO at all. There will not be much overhead (if any at all)
if you push the coordinates every draw call for a simple polygon.
Use a VBO in cases when you have a large quantity of polygons or when
you make large amount of draw calls with the same vertex data in a single frame.
